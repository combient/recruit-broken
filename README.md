# Country browser
With this project, we want to search for countries and get some info about them.

## Instructions
There might be some things that prevents this project from running correctly. Start by getting it up and running and eliminate any obvious bugs that you find.

When you have accomplished this, these are the requirements:

1. You should be able to search for countries by name.
2. Enable the imported font 'Montserrat' for the whole project.
3. No search should be made until the user has stopped typing (wait 1 second).
4. The site should use the United Nations emblem as its favicon (file located in /public/un.svg)
5. On the *Country*-page, you should be able to do the following.
   1. Browse to the neighboring countries
   2. See where the country is located
   3. What its capital is
   4. Show its flag
   5. Show the United Nations emblem if the country is a member of the UN (file located in /public/un.svg)
6. On the *Countries*-page you should be able to do the following
   1. Sort by name, population and size
   2. Navigate to the country's page

Feel free to add any features that you want.

### Bonus points
The site is very boring to look at. Try to give it some flavor. No need for a work of art, but an attempt is greatly appreciated. You are free to use whatever framework/tools you want.
